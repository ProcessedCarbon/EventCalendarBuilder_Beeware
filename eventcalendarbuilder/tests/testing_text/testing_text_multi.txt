Dear All,

I am Associate Professor Jonathan Tan from the School of Social Sciences, NTU. Thank you for your time and patience in reading this announcement.

We are inviting you to participate in a paid economic experiment for a research project (Ref: IRB-2022-358). You can expect to receive up to $25 for your time and effort, depending on your performance and experimental conditions. Payment will be made via PayNow.

During the experiment, you will be asked to answer short questions and make decisions in a series of economic tasks based on your risk and time preference. There is no pre-requisite knowledge required of you, and basic computing skills will suffice. You will make decisions in private and the data we collect from you will be anonymized and not linked to your identity. How much one will eventually earn varies and may depend on participants' decisions, experimental condition, and chance. Payment will be made after the completion of the experiment.

This study will take approximately 1 hour 30 minutes of your time.

The experiment will be held in SHHK CATI Lab, HSS-02-39, SHHK Building, where the School of Social Sciences is located. You can select 3 sessions that you prefer to attend from the list below. You will be randomly assigned to ONE session. Please use the link provided to indicate your preference. Participation is on a first-come-first-serve basis. We have the right to refuse participants when the number of participants needed has been met. Please note that it causes problems when a person signs up but does not attend. Therefore, we ask that you choose a preferred session only if you can attend it. Also, please note that you will not be shortlisted if you have participated in this experiment before (i.e. same IRB reference number).

The sessions are as follows:
15 May (Mon) 9.00am - 10.30am
