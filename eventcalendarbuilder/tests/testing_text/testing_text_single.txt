Dear Students,

The Official Opening of Gaia is just two days away, and we hope you are as excited about it as we are!
We encourage that you arrive early to explore the building and its innovative and sustainable design features.
Enjoy the activities on and off stage, or indulge in delectable hotdog buns, cup corn, ice-cream and refreshing bubble tea. Don't forget to get a taste of nostalgia from the MILO Van at the entrance! Get creative with augmented reality filter photos and enjoy the fun photo booth moments. Of course, remember to take part in a short quiz and stand to win attractive limited-edition door prizes (while stocks last)!
